# Hangman-Game
This is a terminal-based Hangman game built in Python. The player must guess the hidden word one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess reduces the number of lives and builds the hangman step-by-step using ASCII art. The game ends when the word is fully guessed or the hangman is complete.
